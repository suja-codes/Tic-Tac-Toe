### Description 

- This React game is based on synchronization of state between parent (board) and child components (squares).

- Synchronization helps the board to keep track of each square in the game. 

- Each square keeps track of whose turn it is (Player X or Player O).

- This will be updated every time a player selects a square.

- The color of the mark is based on the player's turn. "X" - red, and "O" - white.


### To Run this Program

- Fork and Clone the repository on your local machine.

- Drag and drop the index.html file in a browser tab to play the game.

- Start a http server to improve or play around.


### Future RoadMap

This project can be still be enhanced by 

- using icons for each player.

- adding individualized background for each player when a square is clicked based on turns.
